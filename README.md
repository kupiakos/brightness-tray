# Scrolling Brightness Tray for Ubuntu

This is a small utility designed to place a brightness simple tray that can
be scrolled on with the mouse to adjust the screen brightness for a laptop.

It was intended to be used on Ubuntu 16.04 with Unity, but may work on other
systems.

If it doesn't work, and GTK3 (and maybe other packages) are installed, try
installing `gir1.2-appindicator3-0.1` on Ubuntu.
